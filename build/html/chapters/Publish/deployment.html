<h2>Deployment Status<a class="headerlink" href="#deployment-status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to make survey either accessible, or inaccessible to the public, it must be set to Live or Closed respectively. But, any survey created, by default will have its status set to &#8220;Live&#8221;. &#8220;Closed&#8221; allows the survey creator to build and test their questionnaire in a private environment. Since all surveys are &#8220;Live&#8221; by default, the surveys existence will be unknown to anyone, as the Administrator is in control of informing the rest of the world about its being.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p>You can also alter the deployment status on your survey by clicking &#8220;Live&#8221; or &#8220;Closed&#8221; on your survey in the Survey Dashboard</p>

<p>When a survey is Live, it is a generally advised against changing anything. However, if a addition or subtraction must be made, please refer to the list below to see if your aim is Acceptable, or an Unacceptable Change</p>
<p><strong>Acceptable Changes:</strong> These modifications can be made while responses are being, or have been, collected and will not affect the integrity of the data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Changing the order of questions (Moving questions around on the page, or between pages)</li>
<li>Changing the wording of questions</li>
<li>Add new questions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unacceptable Changes</strong>: These modifications cannot be made while responses are being, or have been, collected as they will affect the integrity of the data.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Deleting questions: Once you delete a question, all of the responses that have been collected for that question will be cleared from the results with no possibility of recovery</li>
<li>Re-arranging choices in a question: If you change the order of choices in a question, the responses will no longer correctly match up, resulting in data integrity issues. Responses are stored based on the location of the choice, not the name of the choice</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="online-deployment-url">
<h2>Online Deployment URL<a class="headerlink" href="#online-deployment-url" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every survey created within an account is defined by its parts; Username and the name of the survey. The Online Deployment URL is what links the world up with your specific survey.</p>
<p>As a result, a URL will always take the username and the name of the survey into consideration when defining itself. In some cases, this can cause a large link that may look off-setting to some potential respondents. It is possible to shorten the URL to a smaller and more manageable size.</p>
<p>Click &#8220;Customize this URL&#8221; beside the Online Deployment URL, enter a desired name, and either &#8220;Valid, click Save to confirm...&#8221; will appear, or &#8220;Already taken, choose another...&#8221; if the URL has already been claimed.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 9.1</em> Customized URL</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, a feature of FluidSurveys is the ability to present a survey in a number of languages (72 to be exact!) which allows for a survey to be deployed in those languages. If, for instance, your survey has English, French and Spanish as the survey languages, then you can send respondents either an English, French, Spanish Link, or the default Online Deployment URL that will use the default survey language. If your survey does not have multiple languages, then the language dropdown will not be visible.</p>

<h2>Embed Code<a class="headerlink" href="#embed-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An alternative way to expanding your surveys horizons via the usual routine, eg., e-mails, QR codes, Social Networking, it is possible to embed the survey directly into your web site, so anyone who visits the site will be able to take the survey via an IFRAME.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">
<a class="screenshot reference internal image-reference" href="../../_images/embed_code.png"><img alt="Embed Survey Code" class="screenshot" src="../../_images/embed_code.png" style="width: 625.1px; height: 63.0px;" /></a>

</div>
<p>You can manually add extra HTML code (to change the height and width, for example) directly into the code. When editing your web site to include your survey, you can refresh your website at any time to preview the changes in your survey.</p>
<p>The survey will take on the default style that we provide and the themer will allow you to dynamically modify what your survey looks like.</p>
<p>If you have <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.com">WordPress</a>, you can take the provided code and copy and paste it into a “Post” or “Page”.</p>

<h2>Custom Survey Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-survey-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past, when you wanted to collect responses from a target audience, eg., Females ages 24-34 who live in Alaska, United States), you&#8217;d have to create your own survey in FluidSurveys, and then work with an external panel management company, or list provider to start collecting responses. But, collecting responses from your target audience is possible within the Custom Survey Panel via CINT.</p>
<p>Custom Survey Panel is available on all plans, including Free, and the cost associated with each &#8220;Completed&#8221; response is based on the type of respondent segment that you are going after (Some segments will be more expensive than other segments &#8211; this is mainly determined by supply/demand in the response marketplace)</p>

<h2>Website Popups<a class="headerlink" href="#website-popups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Popups can be the fastest, and easiest and most effective way for site visitors to come back. Track visitor opinions, gauge trend popularity, and find out what your web site visitors are thinking with a FluidSurveys survey and a Popup. One way to distribute a survey is via a pop-up window on your website. A common use of popups is to ask the user why they are viewing a certain item in the &#8220;Store&#8221; page, or what the visitor would like to see on your web site to guarantee that they will/would return.</p>

<p>Smart phones are becoming more and more common, and a popular way of getting a survey onto a phone is via QR Codes. Like a barcode, the QR code contains all necessary information for your survey to be loaded when scanned via the phones barcode reader. The phone can scan the QR code and be instantly transported to your survey. Each and every survey you create will produce an entirely unique QR code.</p>
<p>You can include this image on your website or on printed material to enable mobile device users to quickly and easily access your survey. To download a QR code for a survey, right click the image and click &#8216;Save Image As&#8217;, or click the &#8216;Save Image&#8217; button at the bottom of this dialog.</p>

<h2>Offline Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#offline-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No matter where we go, it seems as if we can always access the Internet, be it on our laptops, phones or tablets. Whether we’re in a coffee shop or on a bus, our favourite websites are just a click away.</p>
<p>It’s something thats often taken for granted. There are numerous situations, after all, in which obtaining Internet access isn&#8217;t so easy. Perhaps we’re working in the field in a remote area, or we’re at a trade show where the connection is unreliable. Collecting data in such situations is often necessary, but difficult.</p>
<p>Through the use of Offline Mode, it is easy and economical to gather survey response data offline on any PC or tablet, and have it uploaded to a centralized database (FluidSurveys.com) once a connection has been re-established.</p>
<div class="figure align-center">

<p>Designed to run in locations where offline data collection is required (limited or no internet access), FluidSurveys’ Mobile Surveys offer a much more convenient and powerful method than traditional pen &amp; paper.</p>
<p>Sales personnel can now gather feedback as they meet with new clients, researchers can collect data in the field where wireless connections are unavailable, and organizations can set up survey stations at trade shows, kiosks, malls, etc without relying on an internet connection.</p>

<p>When a survey is in Kiosk Mode on a tablet, there is no &#8220;Shift&#8221; key to exit the fullscreen mode. Therefore, the following code will need to be entered anywhere on the survey, which will force the survey out of Kiosk Mode.</p>
<p class="last">HTML Code: &lt;a rel=&#8221;nofollow&#8221; href=&#8221;#&#8221; onclick=&#8221;application.surveyView.unlock()&#8221;&gt;EXIT KIOSK MODE&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<h2>Share With Networks<a class="headerlink" href="#share-with-networks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Any survey you create can keep itself close to the pulse of Internet society with the click of a button. You can easily deploy your survey directly on any of your social networks:</p>

<p>To perform a social network release, click on “Publish” and then select which web site you wish to post on. A popup window will appear asking for your login credentials, and once the information has been entered, you’re done. It’s as easy as 1 – 2 – 3</p>

<div class="section" id="kiosk-mode">
<h2>Kiosk Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#kiosk-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Deploying your survey in kiosk mode allows you to assign a short survey as an &#8220;entrance&#8221; survey. The entrance survey runs only &#8220;one time&#8221; when you first run your survey and then the torch is passed to your main survey. Your main survey will then run in a loop. The responses to the entrance survey will be pre-pended to all responses gathered in that session.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Figure 9.1</em> Kiosk Mode with &#8220;Survey #1&#8221; perpended</p>
</div>
<p>The path a respondent will take is that &#8220;Survey #1&#8221; will be taken once, while the actual survey will constantly loop with a 5 minute timeout timer attached. The first survey is generally a &#8220;Location Survey&#8221;, ie., &#8220;Where is this Kiosk located?&#8221;. Therefore, all responses will have the location perpended. Kiosk mode is perfect for running your survey at a central terminal/computer, whether it’s at a trade show, conference, store, etc.</p>
<p>When kiosk mode is enabled, your survey runs in a loop. Every time a survey response is completed, it automatically refreshes so the next respondent can begin. This allows multiple people to take the survey from one location with ease!</p>
