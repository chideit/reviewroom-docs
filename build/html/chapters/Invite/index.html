<p>FluidSurveys’ comes equipped with an invitation module through which survey links can be sent to potential respondents via email. Contacts can be added manually (one by one or in bulk) or imported directly from a third party address book. After the invitations are sent, the survey creator can keep track of who has received, viewed or completed the survey.</p>
<p>Survey invitations sent with the invitation module contain a customized message and a unique survey link through which the recipient can access the survey. The link includes a unique code that can identify the respondent and can be used by the respondent to re-gain entry and edit the survey, even after it has been submitted.</p>

<p>Additionally, It can often be useful to send out reminders after your survey invitations have been sent. Perhaps individuals may have forgotten about the first email, or it got lost in an overcrowded inbox, etc. Reminders can give potential respondents the little nudge they need to provide you with some valuable feedback.</p>
<p>The process of sending reminders using FluidSurveys is fast and simple. First, from the left hand side toolbar, select the “Reminders/History” button. On this screen, you’ll see a history of all of the survey invitations and reminders that you&#8217;ve sent out.</p>
<p>Clicking &#8220;Send Reminder&#8221; will reveal a slightly different &#8220;Compose&#8221; screen. From here, you are able to enter your reminder message and specify to who the reminder should be sent.</p>

<p>A new contact can be added via the &#8220;Add Contacts&#8221; button within the Address Book. To start the process of uploading contacts from a .CSV or .XLS file, clicking &#8220;Import Contacts&#8221; will present the necessary window to begin the movement</p>

<p>If you have a large collection of contacts that you’d like to invite to take your survey, it might not be feasible to add them individually. In this case, you could bulk import contacts from an .XLS or .CSV file. Address book programs (Outlook, Gmail, Lotus, etc) typically allow you to export contact lists directly into .CSV or .XLS, so you can either use these programs or create your own file.</p>

<p>Once you’ve created your .CSV or .XLS file, select the “Import Contacts” button under the “Individuals to Invite” label. A pop-up will appear prompting you to select your file from your computer and upload it to FluidSurveys.com.</p>
<p>If obtaining a .CSV or .XLS file is not possible, then importing contacts through Plaxo is a possibility. This provides an ease of convenience when dealing with an online mail client (Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail) or Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>Once you’ve uploaded your contacts, they’ll appear in the summary box. If the contact already exists in your Address Book, you will receive a message stating that the address already exists, and therefore has not been added.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A e-mail will not import twice, ie., if the contact has the exact same name, eg., Jason Bourne &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:jason&#37;&#52;&#48;cia&#46;gc">jason<span>&#64;</span>cia<span>&#46;</span>gc</a>&gt; then it will not import, despite being part of the import list. Conversely, if either the name or email address is slightly different, eg., Jason Bourne Cell &lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:jason&#37;&#52;&#48;cia&#46;gc">jason<span>&#64;</span>cia<span>&#46;</span>gc</a>&gt; then it will import as a new contact.</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, a contact column when imported can contain a custom variable, eg., &#8220;Department&#8221; which allows for additional information to be uploaded with contacts, and these can then be viewed alongside their responses.</p>
<p>A survey can appear to be custom created for an individual using {{ invite.&lt;custom_column&gt; }} eg., {{ invite.Department }} will show &#8220;Retired&#8221; for Jason Bourne, but &#8220;Expired&#8221; for Kenneth Kitsum, assuming the column for both Jason and Kenneth were &#8220;Retired&#8221; and &#8220;Expired&#8221; respectively.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In order for your contacts to upload properly with custom fields, the file has to contain the two columns: “Name” and “Email”, in addition to the Custom Fields, which do not need to follow any specific order. During the initial upload, ensure that the checkboxes for your custom fields have been checked off.</p>

<p>Every email sent using the Invite Tool, has an Invite Code appended, which allows for a deep tracking system. However, there are times when using the Invite Tool is not possible, but the need to track responses is still a priority. Within &#8220;Tools&#8221;, there is a &#8220;Generate Invite Codes&#8221; section, that allows for you to generate n number of invite codes, and export the list which will adhere to the same style as using the Invite Tool, ie., &lt;url&gt;/?code=&lt;invite_code&gt;</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is sometimes appropriate to restrict access to your survey so only select individuals have access to it. A perfect way to do this is with invite codes.</p>
<p>Invite codes can be distributed in two ways. If the FluidSurveys’ invitation module is used, the invite code will automatically be appended to the invite link in the email and no work on the part of the respondent is required. If the invitation module is not used, the survey creator can manually generate the invite codes for their survey (as many as necessary). They would then have to provide a unique code for each potential respondent as access to the survey would not be granted without a code.</p>
