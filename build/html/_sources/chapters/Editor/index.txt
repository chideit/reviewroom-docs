You will likely spend much of your time within the Editor, so this chapter is the fries, cheese, and gravy of the manual. Take some time to become familiar with the basic breakdown of how to use the Editor and watch your survey building experience expand your horizons.

In this chapter, you will be introduced to the basic features within the Editor, which will segue you nicely into understanding the basic elements of your survey. From there, you will learn the many dozen question types, and their available options. Finally, we will discuss advanced features, such as File Upload, and a feature we're proud of, Advanced Branching Logic

Therefore, this chapter will teach you how to:

* Build a survey from scratch
* Understand the basic and advanced fundamentals of FluidSurveys questions
* Edit survey questions and answers

.. admonition:: Question

	How many question types does FluidSurveys offer that gives you the flexibility you need to collect information? *Many Dozens*

.. warning:: 

	If a survey has already begun its response collecting phase, then any changes made to variables, choices, or deleting questions will result in a loss of collected data.
