Import from Survey Monkey
-------------------------

Many users make the switch to FluidSurveys after having used other survey software. They’re typically looking for something easier to use with more advanced features, and FluidSurveys is a fit. However, they’ve often already begun building surveys and/or collecting responses with the other software, so switching can be tricky. Today, we’ve added a new feature that’ll make it easy.

You can now import all of your surveys and survey responses from Survey Monkey directly into FluidSurveys. This means that even if you’ve begun your data collection, you can still make the switch without losing any of your work.

Importing surveys and responses is straightforward and can be done in seconds. Click on [+New Survey]
