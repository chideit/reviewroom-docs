Analyze
=======

Remaining with tradition, if the Editor is the meat and potatoes, desert being the Themer, then Analyze is the tea or coffee and gentle conversation after dinner. Analyze has 3 sections:

1. Reports
2. Response Table
3. Export Data

While Item 1 and 3 are available only on a paid plan (Pro and above), the Response Table is available to everyone, as the owner is in charge of their information. 

As a result, this chapter will teach you all of the things you can accomplish, as well as provide a basis for becoming the next big hit at your meeting.
