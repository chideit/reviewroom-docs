ReviewRoom is an online application management tool that provides the most complete solution for managing an entire submission process - from organizing workflow and collecting applications to evaluating submissions and reporting. ReviewRoom is designed and built specially for the social web; this allows for the process of monitoring an application to be available online, 24/7, 365, and all around the world. Many leading and fast-growing organizations use ReviewRoom to streamline, organize, and collect forms and other documents/video submissions and transform online review/management (used for awards, grants, scholarships, certification process, program admissions, essay/video contests, conference/event registrations and more)

This manual will show you the in-and-outs of ReviewRoom, all the way from adding Groups, to setting up Triggers to help push a fully automated online application management tool.

Furthermore, the process of creating forms is handled through the inclusion of FluidSurveys -- our other product -- which provides users with a simple do it yourself platform to create online surveys & polls, gather responses and analyze data. With no software to download, an easy to use drag & drop interface and an extremely rich feature base, FluidSurveys is the ideal tool for online research.
